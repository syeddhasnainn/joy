Initialize the project with `npm init -y`\n4. Install Express: `npm install express`\n5. Create an `app.js` file with the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis creates a basic server with a single GET route. You can add more routes and functionality as needed."
